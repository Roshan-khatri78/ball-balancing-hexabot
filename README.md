## ⚠️ Current Project Status

This repository currently holds **Phase 1: Simulation and AI Algorithm Development**.

- Simulated ball balancing environment using Python and OpenCV.
- AI-enhanced PID control algorithms tested in simulation.
- ESP32 firmware adapted for simulation.

The **real hardware implementation (Phase 2)** including servos, ESP32, LCD, and physical platform will be developed and uploaded later under the `Phase2/` directory.
