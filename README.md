# üü† Ball Balancing Hexabot

A final-year BEI major project (2078 batch) from **Purwanchal Campus, Dharan-08, Sunsari** under **IOE**, this system balances a ball on a hexagonal platform using real-time image processing and servo control.

---

## üéØ Project Overview

This project uses:
- **OpenCV** for real-time ball tracking via webcam
- **PID control** to calculate corrections
- **ESP32** to drive 3 servo motors (MG996R)
- A **hexagonal tilting base** to stabilize the ball dynamically

The system simulates a feedback-controlled stabilizer and can be visualized or tuned through a UI or display.

## üéÆ Interactive LCD & Button Control

The system includes a **5-button interface** with an **I2C LCD display** allowing users to interactively select commands such as:

- **Start Balancing**
- **Move Left / Right / Forward / Backward**
- **Center Ball**
- **PID Mode: Manual / Auto**
- **Exit / Reset**

### How it works:
- The **LCD** continuously shows the current mode or command.
- Users navigate through the menu with:
  - 4 directional push buttons (Up, Down, Left, Right)
  - 1 Select button (OK)
- The selected menu item is highlighted on the LCD.
- Pressing OK executes the corresponding command (e.g., servo angle adjustment).
- Advanced features may include real-time PID tuning, live ball position display, and status updates.
